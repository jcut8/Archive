This repository contains files that are for a senior project at Saint Martin's Univeristy. The project is an advisory assistant program that is meant to provide students with a schedule that fits their needs as well as their degree requirements. The web based program can read in a students transcripts to check which courses the student has taken and will tell them which courses they need to complete. The student can then input which courses they need into a user generated schedule to plan out when they will be taking the needed courses.
